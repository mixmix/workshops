Here's the period we're reviewing. You can see some of the milestones.
These are to remind us of where we've come from and get us into a space to reflect on that period.

I'll talk us through this map then ask everyone to come up and draw a 'mood curve' on the timeline. 
The top is "having a great time". 
The bottom is "no good at all".

We're not going to explore everyones experience at this point, but we might reference this diagram as we're discussing specific experiences later.
