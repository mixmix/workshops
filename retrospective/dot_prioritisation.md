We don't have time to adress everything people have raised here today. 

What we can do is make a note of what's been raised, then agree on some of the most important things to discuss.
In this way we can make a small inroad on the big topics, so that we can be confident we are coming away with some small things to change for next time. 

Steps : 
-------

1. group the cards into similar areas
2. everyone gets 3-5 dots to allocate
3. 1 minute to plan your dotting
4. We start with the most important cards and get as far as we can


Additional tools : 
------------------

- timebox to 10 mins, when time is up, decide if need another 2 mins. stop after 12 mins.
- check if there are any small things that are just Notes, and not Discussion
