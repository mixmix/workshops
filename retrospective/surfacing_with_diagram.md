You've got 3-5 mins to write up things reflections on the period. These could be clear likes/ dislikes, or observations which might warrant exploring. 

After that time, we're going to put up post-its on this diagram I've drawn on the whiteboard. 
You'll read your card, and place it on the diagram in the place that makes sense, with a brief note about why. 

e.g. "I didn't know who was in charge of the presentations", or, "how do we know who's navigating", so this goes on the ship.

If you've got the same card or something very similar, announce that card and place it at the same time.
